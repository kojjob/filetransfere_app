## Recommended Pricing Strategy

### Option 1: Competitive Pricing (Recommended)

**Rationale**: Match or slightly undercut competitors while highlighting unique features (real-time progress, API access).

| Tier | Price | Transfer/Month | Max File Size | API Calls | Team Size | Competitive Position |
|------|-------|----------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 5GB | 2GB | 0 | 1 user | ✅ Competitive |

**Changes**:
- Pro: $29 → **$9/month** (69% reduction)
- Business: $99 → **$19/month** (81% reduction)
- Added Team tier at $49/month

**Justification**:
- Lower barrier to entry
- Still 70-80% gross margins

| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited | Custom | Unlimited | Unlimited |

**Changes**:

| **Business** | **$39/month** | 500GB | 50GB | Unlimited | 25 users | Automation, Zapier |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited | Custom | Unlimited | Unlimited | White-label, SSO |

**Changes**:
- Pro: $29 → **$15/month** (48% reduction)
- Business: $99 → **$39/month** (61% reduction)

**Justification**:
- Still premium but more reasonable
- Real-time progress is unique (worth premium)
- API access not available in free tiers elsewhere
- Better margins than Option 1

## Recommended: Option 1 (Competitive Pricing)

### Revised Pricing Structure

| Tier | Price | Transfer/Month | Max File Size | API Calls | Team Size | Value Prop |
|------|-------|----------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
